## 🏗️ Architecture

The application follows a clean **OOP architecture** with layered separation:

| Layer          | Description                                      |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Models**     | `User`, `Bike`, `Booking` — ES6 classes          |
| **Repository** | `LocalStorageRepository` — generic CRUD over localStorage |
| **Services**   | `UserService`, `BikeService`, `BookingService` — business logic |
| **Controller** | `AppController` — UI rendering, event binding, navigation |
| **Utilities**  | `Toast`, `Router`, `Session` — UI helpers         |
